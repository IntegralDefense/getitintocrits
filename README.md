GET IT INTO CRITS
-----------------
HEY! GET IT INTO CRITS!

You have data. You need it into CRITS. Let's do it!

It can be a struggle to import data into CRITS and also generate meaningful relationships between that data. Doing so manually in the CRITS GUI requires many hours of point and click. I prefer command line.

The conventions used here take some effort to learn, but it has saved our team a lot of time.

Some of this stuff is hard coded. It will be cleaned up eventually.
